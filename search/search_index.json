Moreover, it is essential that service needs are continuously assured even if transport network anomalies (e.g., link failures) occur. Herein, we present an implemented resource orchestrator architecture integrating monitoring capabilities to attain closed-loop operations for: i) gathering monitored information; ii) detecting transport network anomalies; and iii) triggering the required action (e.g., restoration) to keep the service continuity. When a link failure happens, several transport services may be disrupted requiring to be immediately restored. To this end, we propose a novel on-line restoration algorithm called as Global Concurrent Optimization (GCO). The GCO algorithm aims at attaining an enhanced restorability performance compared to a more traditional restoration algorithm (referred to as 1-by-1). Both algorithms are experimentally compared on top of the deployed resource orchestrator architecture.

In this context, the EU-H2020 5Growth project defines a service and infrastructure orchestration architecture to automatically deploy network services (NSes) fulfilling vertical demands. In this architecture, the Service Orchestrator (5Gr-SO), as a service provider, maps the vertical service needs into NS requirements (e.g., CPU, RAM, bandwidth, etc.). The 5Gr-SO interacts with an underlying infrastructure orchestrator referred to as 5Gr-RL. The 5Gr-RL, as an infrastructure provider, handles two main functions: i) abstraction of the resources exposed to the 5GrSO, and ii) fine-grained resource selection. Different interaction forms between both 5Gr-SO and 5Gr-RL arise differing in the exchanged abstracted information and resource allocation. We present two 5Gr-SO and 5Gr-RL interaction solutions stemming from two 5Gr-RL operational modes: Infrastructure Abstraction (InA) and Connectivity Service Abstraction (CSA). In the InA approach, the 5Gr-SO is granted with an aggregated view of the computing resources and a set of transport logical links between the cloud locations. In the CSA strategy, besides the aggregated view of the cloud resources, the logical links are associated to potential connectivity service types. Both InA and CSA strategies are presented describing their pros and cons. Moreover, the designed workflows (involving the devised abstraction and allocation algorithms) between the 5Gr-SO and 5Gr-RL entities are experimentally validated.

Aiming at increasing the VNF service satisfaction rates and minimizing the deployment cost, we use both transport and cloud-aware VNF scaling as well as multi-attribute decision making (MADM) algorithms for VNF placement inside the cluster. The original joint scaling and placement problem is known to be NP-hard and hence the problem is solved by separating scaling and placement problems and solving them individually. The experiments are done using a dataset containing the information of a deployed digital-twin network service. These experiments show that considering transport and cloud parameters during scaling and placement algorithms perform more efficiently than the only cloud based or transport based scaling followed by placement algorithms. One of the MADM algorithms, Total Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), has shown to yield the lowest deployment cost and highest VNF request satisfaction rates compared to only transport or cloud scaling and other investigated MADM algorithms. Our simulation results indicate that considering both transport and cloud parameters in various availability scenarios of cloud and transport resources has significant potential to provide increased request satisfaction rates when VNF scaling and placement using the TOPSIS scheme is performed.</p> <p>\u2b05 Back to Publications</p>"},{"location":"publications/2023_AnServApp_Zeydan/","title":"A Marketplace Solution for Distributed Network Management and Orchestration of Slices","text":"<p>Authors: E.

We focus on a hierarchical MANO implementation where a Resource Layer orchestrator handles the configuration of the physical infrastructure and exposes an abstract view of it to the upper-layer Service Orchestrator. Two different abstraction philosophies are adopted, namely the Infrastructure Abstraction, which pre-calculates the resource allocations before advertising them, and the Connection Service Abstraction, which exposes potential connectivity services without an actual resource allocation. The resulting abstracted infrastructure becomes the input of the Service Orchestrator to make (placement) decisions fulfilling the NS demands. Thus, a novel placement algorithm is devised which, unlike previous works, can handle NSes with arbitrary VNF topology demands. The performance of the MANO functions is experimentally evaluated by dynamically creating/terminating heterogeneous NSes in terms of: NS blocking, blocked bandwidth/VNF ratio, bandwidth occupancy, and VNF distribution per cloud site. From the results, Connection Service Abstraction does attain a more efficient use of resources and in general, performs better than the Infrastructure Abstraction approach.</p> <p>\u2b05 Back to Publications</p>"},{"location":"publications/2024_ACCESS_Barrachina/","title":"Empowering Beyond 5G Networks: An Experimental Assessment of Zero-Touch Management and Orchestration","text":"<p>Authors: S.

In this paper, we first propose a new vision for distributed network management and orchestration based on existing standardization architectures. This vision aims to embed AI/Machine Learning (ML) into the AI/ML architectures of Standardization Development Organizations (SDOs) such as the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Our second contribution is a numerical comparison of the benefits of the proposed distributed management and orchestration approach in terms of energy savings through Federated Learning (FL). The experimental topology includes a sophisticated infrastructure with VR streaming clients and servers, a monitoring system (MS), core network elements, aggregation server for federated learning (FL) and analytics engines (AEs). The deployment uses Kubernetes (K8s) and a top orchestrator that works together with an AI/ML model tailored to the envisioned use case. Experimental studies emulating the demanding Virtual Reality (VR) video streaming have demonstrated the effectiveness of the MonB5G framework in optimizing resource management, reducing overhead and improving energy efficiency. In particular, when convergence is achieved, the monitoring overhead is reduced by more than 11 times compared to the centralised SLA-constrained algorithm, along with data-driven management systems. This led to a more than 10-fold improvement in energy efficiency.
