# Brand-new Web

As a software developer, it's important to have a personal website that showcases your skills and experience. One way to quickly create a static website is by using the static site generator MkDocs. In this blog post, I will share my experience creating a personal page using <a href="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/" target="_blank">MkDocs</a>.

Overall, I found MkDocs to be a quick and easy way to create a static website. Its simple Markdown syntax and powerful features make it a great choice for creating personal pages and other static websites. I highly recommend giving it a try if you're in need of a simple website solution.
