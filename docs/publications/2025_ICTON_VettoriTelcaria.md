## Abstract

As network technology evolves toward 6G, effective network-monitoring systems become essential to support automation and intelligence. These systems must enable accurate, real-time data collection while maintaining flexibility for diverse data sources. This paper introduces two versatile, data-agnostic telemetry systems designed to address the complexities of next-generation 6G networks. The first system, the CONTELEMMonitoring-Agent, provides real-time, multi-source telemetry with fault detection, performance optimization, and automated network management. Its modular, plugin-based architecture supports dynamic integration of various data sources. The second system, the WHITOPEN OpenConfig/gNMI Agent, offers a standardized interface for configuring and managing network elements, enabling real-time monitoring through an OpenConfig and gNMI frameworks. Both systems offer scalable and adaptable performance across various network configurations. The paper details related technologies, modular architectures, and experimental validation using an autonomous SDN controller. Finally, it highlights key contributions and explores future enhancements.
