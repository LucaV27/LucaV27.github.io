## Abstract

The composition of NFV-network services (NSs) helps 5G networks to provide the required flexibility and dynamicity to satisfy the needs of vertical industries. The mentioned capabilities are required not only at instantiation time but also during operation time to maintain the corresponding service level agreements in the presence of changing network conditions. In this demonstration, we present the capabilities of the 5Growth platform to handle the scaling of composite NSs under different situations. In particular, we show the scaling of a composite NS implying the update of the required deployed nested NS components and its interconnections but also how the scaling of a shared single NS entails updates on its associated composite NSs.
