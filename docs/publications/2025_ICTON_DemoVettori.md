## Abstract

Modern multi-vendor, disaggregated networks enhance operational flexibility but introduce challenges in unified control especially in end-to-end service orchestration. This work presents a hierarchical SDN control framework that enables coordinated management across heterogeneous network domains (PON, packet switching, and optical transport). By leveraging standardized interfaces and real-time telemetry (via of RESTCONF, NETCONF, gNMI), the system supports automated service provisioning and failure recovery while maintaining interoperability in the disaggregated environments. Implemented and validated in the CTTC ADRENALINE testbed®, our solution demonstrates inter-domain service orchestration through a parent controller, telemetry-driven restoration with minimal disruption and a vendor-agnostic operation via open APIs.
