## Abstract

Next generation mobile networks require flexibility and dynamicity to satisfy the needs of vertical industries. This may entail the deployment of slices instantiated in the form of composite network services (NSs) spanning multiple administrative domains through network service federation (NSF). In this way, different nested NSs of the composite service can be deployed by different service providers. But fulfilling the needs of verticals is not only needed during instantiation time but also during NS operation to honour the required service level agreements (SLAs) under changing network conditions. In this demonstration, we present the capabilities of the 5Growth platform to handle the scaling of federated NSs. In particular, we show the scale out/in of a nested NS deployed in a federated domain, which is part of a composite NS. These scaling operations, triggered to maintain the NS SLAs, imply a set of coordinated operations between involved administrative domains.
