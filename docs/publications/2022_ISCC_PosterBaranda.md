## Abstract

Heterogeneity is one relevant characteristic of next generation mobile networks. This term embraces not only different kind of infrastructure resources or transmission technologies (e.g., networking vs computing, wireless vs optical), but it also applies to different ways of implementing the network functions (NFs) composing the network services (NSs). This allows the definition of hybrid NSs combining different kind of components, such as physical, virtual, and cloud-native NFs. This demonstration shows the enhancements introduced in the 5Growth platform to manage physical NFs, hence increasing the capabilities of this platform to cope with more heterogeneous hybrid NSs in multi-site scenarios. In particular, we show the deployment of an NS constituted by physical, virtual, and cloud-native NFs implementing an end-to-end service covering access, mobile core and application functionalities.
