## Abstract

The automation and flexibility introduced in the management and orchestration of B5G/6G mobile networks are allowing the creation of innovative vertical use cases considering the coordination of multiple provider domains owned by different operators and/or service providers. The first step to enable this automation is the onboarding of network service artefacts prior to enabling its instantiation in such challenging scenarios. This demonstration focuses on the automatic onboarding operation in a multi-administrative domain scenario. We propose a cloud-native solution deployed at each administrative domain made of an artefact registry management system coupled with an Integration Fabric element following ETSI ZSM guidelines. These elements synchronize between them autonomously and with the associated ETSI NFV management and orchestration stacks ensuring a consistent catalogue of vertical services at the different administrative domains.
