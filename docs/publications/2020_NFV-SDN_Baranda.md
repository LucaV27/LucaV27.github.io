## Abstract

The automated assurance of vertical service level agreements (SLA) is a challenge in 5G networks. The EU 5Growth project designs and develops a 5G End-to-End service platform that integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques for any decision-making process in the management and orchestration (MANO) stack. This paper presents the detailed architecture and first prototype of the 5Growth platform taking AI/ML-based network service auto-scaling decisions. This also includes the modification of the ETSI network service descriptors for requesting AI/ML-based decisions for orchestration problems and the integration of a data engineering pipeline for real-time data gathering and model execution. Our evaluation shows that AI/ML-related service handling operations (1–2 s.) are well below instantiation/termination procedures (80/60 s., respectively). Furthermore, online classification can be performed in the order of hundreds of milliseconds (600 ms).
